## About the project. 🪴
### Purpose. 🎯
The purpose of this repository is to track the things I learn in Rust. 📚


### Built With. ⚒️
The programs can be build with Cargo and Rust compiler.

## Getting Started. 🚀
### System requirements ✅
- Operating System: MacOS, Windows, Linux(Ubuntu for example), Windows Subsystem for Linux. (WSL)
- Programming Language: Rust
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 

I used WSL as operating system, VSCode as code editor and to compile the code I made use of Rust compiler.

### Installation. 🪜
1. Install Rust
   ```sh
   $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

   ```

2. Compile from command line
   ```sh
   rustc main.rs
   
   ```
   
3. VSCode Rust extesion
   ```sh
   (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
   ```
   
4. Configure VSCode to run and debug C/C++ programs inside VSCode under WSL.
   ```sh
   Up now I didn't test a method to see if it works.
   ```
